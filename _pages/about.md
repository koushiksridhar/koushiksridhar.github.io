<h4> About </h4>

I'm a Master's Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill student passionate about building impactful products. I am a researcher at the [Neuro Image Research and Analysis Lab](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/research/niral/) and a Former Director and current Advisor @ [HackNC](https://hacknc.com/).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in interdisciplinary applications of data science and modeling. My work has focused on analyzing medical data through AI to generate impactful outcomes. I'm currently working on analyzing Brain MRI data with text embeddings in Transformer/GAN models. 

I've previously worked in Full Stack and Data Science roles at [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal) and as a Blockchain Developer at the [SoloCoin](https://www.solocoin.app/) startup. I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2024.

<!-- I am a [Luther-Hodges Scholar](https://hodgesscholars.unc.edu/), [Davidson Fellow](https://www.davidsongifted.org/), and alumni of the [Research Science Institute](https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute). -->
