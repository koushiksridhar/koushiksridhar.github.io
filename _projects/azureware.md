## Summary
Parkinson’s Disease is one of the most common neurological diseases in modern day society. As Parkinson’s Disease continues to worsen over time, severe symptoms arise. These effects of Parkinson’s can be alleviated through early detection. Currently, there is no dedicated test for diagnosing Parkinson’s Disease. Current research for detecting Parkinson’s focuses on the creation of products that are time-consuming, not easy to use, or expensive. Therefore, to solve these issues, the AzureWare App was developed. AzureWare serves as an all in one application for diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's Disease. 
Several Neural Networks (RNNs with LSTM) were built and tested according to a dataset on Parkinson’s Speech featuring several voice characteristics and values. After determining the best Neural Network, an Android App was developed to provide an easy-to-navigate testing interface for doctors, caregivers, and patients. With the app, users are able to get their diagnosis immediately, based on the Neural Network algorithm implemented in the app. Furthermore, its monitoring features using onboard accelerometers provide data regarding the prognosis of Parkinson's. With extra sharing features, AzureWare sets the basis for a data-driven approach in medicine.
